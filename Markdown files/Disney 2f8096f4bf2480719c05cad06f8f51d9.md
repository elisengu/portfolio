Creating lightning-fast webpages

# **What I Did:**

From June to December 2020, I interned as a front-end development intern at Disney. I implemented [Google AMP](https://amp.dev/) web component framework into all articles on Disney-branded websites and redesigned the pages based on the framework's constraints. This effort was to improve mobile loading time, user retention, and search rankings. I also created high-fidelity prototypes of e-commerce flows to enhance guests' experiences across Disney Parks & Resorts Digital.

# **What I Learned:**

I got to use new tools like Sketch and Mustache.js and learned more about how to design better experiences for users from responsive design to accessibility. My work required a lot of cross-team collaboration, allowing me to improve my communication and problem-solving skills as I iterated on designs and implementations with fellow product managers, engineers, and designers.
