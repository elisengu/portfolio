                    <h2>A disconnected shopping experience.</h2>
                    <p>
                        Readers use Goodreads to track books they want to read, but this information isn't easily accessible when they shop on Amazon. As a result, users struggle to find, compare, and purchase books already saved to their Want to Read shelf. With 41.7M linked Goodreads and Amazon customers, we saw an opportunity to further integrate Goodreads into Amazon for a more seamless and personalized shopping experience.

                        Members who have linked their Amazon and Goodreads accounts can now see books from their Want to Read shelf in Amazon Your books.

                    <p>
                        Customers who link their Goodreads and Amazon accounts face friction when moving from trusted discovery on Goodreads to purchasing on Amazon, often requiring disruptive context-switching. Data showed this separation was intentional—only one-third of linked users maintain lists on both platforms, and just one-fifth of books overlap—reflecting a clear mental divide between Goodreads as an impartial discovery space and Amazon as a transactional one. This created a central design challenge: <strong>reducing friction through integration without undermining the trust and perceived neutrality that make Goodreads valuable</strong>, especially given user concerns that closer commercial ties could compromise recommendation integrity.

                        After extensive debate and design critiques with both Amazon and Goodreads design teams, <strong>we aligned on fully integrating Goodreads Want to Read into the existing Your Books experience rather than introducing a separate Goodreads tab</strong>. This approach builds on customers' current mental models, avoids fragmenting the experience, and reduces cognitive load by keeping interactions consistent across tabs. It also prevents duplicative views—since WTR filtering already exists across secondary tabs—while enabling WTR books to benefit from Your Books' advanced shopping filters and recommendations. Importantly, this structure scales to future shelf expansion without creating false expectations about full Goodreads parity. To address discoverability, we paired the integration with Goodreads badging on WTR titles, branded filters across tabs, and lightweight, dismissible education surfaces introducing the feature and promoting account linking.

                        The next question became how do we differentiate whether a book was saved from Amazon or Goodreads? This proved a complicated topic, as WTR is read-only on Amazon (for now), and Amazon books have a heart that denotes whether it's been added to a wishlist or not (it's also tappable). I explored a multitude of options including adding the Goodreads logo below or on the book cover, different labels, stacked logos. Some key considerations arose:

                        <li>Prioritize wishlist control (heart) vs. source of book (Goodreads badge)</li>

                        After evaluating three badging options for indicating Goodreads Want to Read status, <strong>user research showed a clear preference for the "On Goodreads shelf" label (Option 1) due to its clarity and recognizability</strong>, despite being less visually elegant and taking up more space. While logo-only approaches felt cleaner, they introduced discoverability risks—particularly for non-Goodreads users—and reduced confidence in understanding a book's status. Given the feature's newness and the goal of launching quickly, we chose the least-change, most explicit solution to prioritize comprehension over visual minimalism. As the integration matures and Goodreads shelves expand to read/write, a more compact, symbol-based approach may be revisited to improve concision and elegance.

                    <h2>What I learned</h2>
                    <p>
                        Working on this integration taught me how to <strong>design effectively across two distinct platforms and brands while navigating complex cross-team dynamics</strong>. Because this feature spanned Goodreads and Amazon, success depended on tight collaboration across PM, UX, engineering, UXR, and marketing—often amid differing goals, ongoing design changes, and constant reviews.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learned how to <strong>drive alignment on HDTs and decisions, field and synthesize feedback from many stakeholders, and design within an existing information architecture</strong> that differed significantly from both Goodreads and Kindle. Just as importantly, I learned how to thoughtfully merge two brands by respecting what makes each valuable to users, prioritizing transparency and user choice around privacy, and making deliberate decisions around hierarchy, badging, and interaction patterns so the integration felt helpful rather than intrusive.
