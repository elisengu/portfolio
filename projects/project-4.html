As a product design intern, I worked on their electronic health diary web-app MyDiya that allows patients to record their medical history and daily changes in health. Working with a group of three other designers, we were tasked with redesigning MyDiya to be more usable for patients.

                        The MyDiya app has extensive telehealth capabilities like being able to record one's vitals, import health records, and track symptoms. However, the CEO informed us that users struggled to use these capabilities, either because too much information was displayed or it was hard to navigate to that information.

                        The left sidebar contains 8 less icons in the new redesign, reducing the cognitive load on the user. It also contains icons better representing its purpose. Furthermore, instead of icons' accompanying text always displaying, icon text only displays when the user hovers over the icon for more information. This gives more space for main content on the right-hand side.

                    <p>
                        DiyaHealth anticipated and began marketing to new users during the COVID-19 pandemic when a telemedicine app like MyDiya is needed most. It was crucial to offer usable, free, and remote healthcare, as in-person doctor appointments were not safe and health disparities were worsening. A survey of about 300 practitioners (oncologists, specialists, and primary care) further confirmed this influx of new users during the pandemic.

                        Since the goal of our redesign was to attract and retain users during the pandemic, <strong>we surveyed 32 first-time users</strong> with the help of our team's product manager. Our intention with the survey was to understand how users interact with the app and what, if any, features needed to be improved to make the app more useful to users. We kept track of users' first impressions, pain points, and expectations in a Google spreadsheet.

                        Patients' health conditions are diverse from being old to young or having multiple diseases or none. In line with DiyaHealth's mission to democratize health, we wanted to ensure our redesign would target all types of users. We worked with the health professionals on our team to create diverse personas with various health conditions, ages, and backgrounds (all of which affect how a user might interact with the app).

On the second iteration, we collaborated with healthcare professionals on our team to make the homepage more <strong>informative</strong> for users' daily health. Our last iteration added colors and animations to make the design <strong>engaging</strong> and to best utilize cards to organize the health features.

                    <p>
                        Users expressed confusion with the tracker page's elements and unclear call to actions in the initial user survey. To redesign the tracker, we first consulted Diya Health's CEO and engineers to fully deconstruct and understand all the page's elements. This helped us better convey the true purposes of all the tracker's elements. With each iteration, we reorganized the tracker's information to be clearer to users. After showing these to our team and users for feedback, we added final touches like color to make a high fidelity wireframe.

                        Users found the navigation not intuitive as certain pages were hidden until configured in users' settings and users were often redirected to pages they did not expect. As we were designing a solution, we asked ourselves a key question:

                        <strong>We chose to simplify the navigation, rather than teach users to use a more complicated interface.</strong> Though this takes more design and development work, it ultimately saves users the most time. When in doubt, put users first. To simplify the navigation, we redesigned the navigation flow using interaction diagrams and removed the features visibility feature, opting to make all features visible on the homepage and not at all visible on the left navigation bar. <strong>This reduced the number of tabs on the left sidebar by 8.</strong>

                        <strong>Fast-paced, cross-team collaboration.</strong><br>
                        Working with a team of engineers, healthcare professionals, and marketers meant learning to clearly present and justify my design decisions during team meetings. Making high fidelity prototypes was key to help engineers understand how feasible our designs were compared to the deployed app. Also, working in a startup meant that I took a lot of ownership over my work and took initiative outside of my role through starting meeting notes, Zoom meetings, and Slack channels.

                        Unfortunately, my internship ended before I could find out the results of my redesign. I would conduct more research, measuring user metrics and KPIs like amount spent on app per day, how many users, and how many doctor referrals made to evaluate if the redesigns improved users' experience. Then, I would reiterate on these designs further. I would also address the rest of the pain points discussed in our initial user research.
