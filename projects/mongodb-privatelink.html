                        MongoDB is an open-source, no SQL database platform that offers a variety of products to help companies manage their hu(mongo)us amounts of data. As a product design intern, I created a high-fidelity Figma prototype to describe a smooth, easy-to-use private endpoint creation and connection experience that would allow customers to securely use MongoDB products.

                    <p>
                        MongoDB regularly communicates with its users through a custom feedback forum. Here, we found that many users (56, to be exact) wanted to use the company's newest products, Atlas Data Lake (ADL) and Online Archive (OA). Yet, due to security concerns, they could not use these MongoDB products.

                    <p>
                        Since we knew what users wanted through the feedback forum, my first step as the primary designer on this project was to collaborate with engineers to figure out how we could allow users to connect to MongoDB products using AWS's Private Link service. I took notes, made diagrams, and user flows to break down a highly technical process into steps everyday users could understand.

                    <p>
                        Once I created a user flow, it was time to translate these steps into a user interface. I used design components like forms, tables, modals, and radio buttons to construct the interface. I applied MongoDB's design system to each component to ensure consistency amongst all MongoDB products and services.

                        Every week, my design manager hosts a design collab session (basically a design jam) where all designers on our team share our work for informal critiques. I presented my designs, got feedback, and then we all jumped into my Figma file to iterate in real time. Here are just a few of the ideas we explored.

                        Once I had a complete Figma prototype, I tested it with users through 1-hr moderated interviews. Before the interviews, I prepared a brief describing my goals. I also added instructions for tasks for the users to complete in the prototype, then asked users to reflect on their experience.

                        I was presenting my designs to the engineering team for feedback almost every week. Halfway through the project, engineers discovered a few more requirements through a Proof of Concept (POC). These changes required me to redo my user flow and designs. This taught me to be flexible in my designs and forced me to learn shortcuts to work fast in Figma to adapt to these changes.

                    <h2>What I learned.</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Managing changing requirements</strong><br>
                        With such a technical project, much of my designs depended on engineering requirements which changed a lot while I was working on this project. Managing these requirements meant constant Slack communication and frequent engineering checkpoints.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Design unites people</strong><br>
                        Throughout my project I heavily collaborated with copywriters, engineers, fellow designers, marketers, and product managers. It was so awesome to see how design could create a vision, a blueprint, upon which an idea for a feature can become reality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Asking the right questions</strong><br>
                        In this project, there were many decisions to make: from how many steps should be in the endpoint creation wizard to whether a description should be added to product options. My mentor stressed that I take ownership of my design, prompting me to talk through the pros and cons of each design variant. This helped me improve my design thinking skills and forced me to asking the right questions.
